# Codeworks Pre Course Curriculum

This pre course is important, because it allows students to have a solid common ground when the main course starts. Understanding the theory part and solving the exercises included here is required for you to proceed to the main course.

We’re providing two check-ins and support sessions with instructors along the way, to test your progress, help you clarify any doubts, and be sure you’re on track for success.

Be aware that not completing this material and not attending both support sessions leads to rescheduling or canceling your main course.

### Communications

Please get in touch with “<students@codeworks.me>” to schedule your support sessions in advance. Make sure you have the first one at least 4 to 3 weeks, and the second one at least 2 to 1 week respectively before the main course starts.

For each support session you need to have progressed with code in exercises, and bring a list of topics you want to clarify. Failing to do so raises flags about your ability to attend the course.

You should have received an invite to the Codeworks Slack team (if not, please let us know by email). Make sure you keep the [Slack](https://slack.com/) app installed on your mobile phone (and you’re logged in, with notifications turned on), as from this point onwards we might use this channel to communicate instead of email, for anything that is time-sensitive or benefits from a group conversation.

### Equipment

To attend the main course you need to bring a laptop computer. If you consider buying a new one, as a Codeworks student you have access to [Apple discounts for Education](http://www.apple.com/es-edu/shop) (~10% reduction from the regular price). To apply this you need to be in Barcelona and either attending classes at our campus or about to start. The request to Apple needs to originate from our office, so in case get in touch by email and we’ll help you out.

## Course structure

The pre course material is divided in two main parts: theory and exercises (as respectively described in the `theory.md`, and `exercises.md` files). We suggest you to start with theory sections from 1 to 6, and then do the exercises while you complete theory sections 7 and 8 on the side.

## Study tips

If a concept is not clear, look for extra information online (videos, tutorials, blogs, forums, etc). Also, consider sleeping over it and tackle it again the next day: you’ll notice that in the meantime your brain keeps elaborating information in the background.

Another important resource is the “Intro to programming” [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/269692903396564/): use it to interact with other students and get unstuck. Instructors loosely follow the conversation, and will help when needed.

After having taken the above steps, make sure you keep a written list of anything that you still want to clarify, so you can discuss it with instructors during the support sessions. Our advice is to distribute the two sessions evenly as you progress through the pre course material.

Finally, in case you find any bugs, broken links, typos, outdated info, or have feedback on how to improve this curriculum please shoot an email to “<instructors@codeworks.me>”, so we can keep making it better.

### Extra credits

After you have completed all theory and exercises, if you have time left to study before joining the main course, feel free to challenge yourself with the “extra credits” sections.

These sections are not mandatory, and can take a long time to complete, but offer a sneak peek into some topics that will be covered during the main course.

## Ready, set, go!

Ok, now you should be ready to start digging into `theory.md`!
